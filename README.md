# Chatting-with-Documents
Chatting with a document is an innovative project designed to enhance the interaction and extraction of information from PDF documents using natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). The primary objective of Chatting with a document  is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to query PDF documents in natural language and receive accurate, context-aware responses.

The system utilizes a combination of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction from PDF files and advanced NLP algorithms to interpret and process user queries. By integrating these technologies, Chatting with a document  can handle various types of PDF documents, including scanned images, text-heavy files, and complex layouts, making it versatile and effective for a wide range of applications.

Key features of Chatting with a document include:

# Natural Language Querying:
Users can ask questions about the content of the PDF documents in natural language, and the system will provide relevant answers, significantly improving the accessibility of information.
# Text Extraction and Summarization: 
The tool can extract text from PDFs and summarize large documents, helping users quickly grasp the essential points without reading through the entire document.
Interactive Interface: Chatting with a document  offers an intuitive and interactive interface that simplifies document navigation and information retrieval.
This project aims to streamline the process of information extraction from PDF documents, making it easier for professionals in various fields, including academia, business, and legal sectors, to find and utilize information efficiently.
